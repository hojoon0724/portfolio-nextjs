    text: 'In 2021, I co-founded a contemporary classical music concert series and developed its brand identity and graphic standards. Unlike traditional classical music concerts, I aim to immerse the audience in the performance, using lights and visual elements to make them feel like an integral part of the show. I design dynamic projections and program stage lighting live, with the full music score in front of me, creating a sensory experience where the audience can ’see’ the music and feel its energy, rather than simply being passive observers. This approach brings a new dimension to classical concerts, much like what is common in other music genres.',
